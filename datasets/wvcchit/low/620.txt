The HIE shall be able to register patient preferences to participate or not participate in the HIE for uses other than  direct delivery of information in fulfillment of an order.   This criteria is not intended to prohibit HIEs from meeting any legal or regulatory requirements that an HIE may be subject to.    An HIE can meet this criteria by implementing these preferences centrally or by ensuring that the Edge systems implement these preferences.

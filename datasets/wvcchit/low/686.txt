"The system shall support the identification of original source author and date/time of documentation that is originated in prior encounters and brought into a current encounter using system functions.  When system tools (examples are templates or defaults) are used to create an encounter note, the use of this mechanism should be retained in an edit trail for each portion of a note for which it was used."

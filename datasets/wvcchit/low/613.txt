"S 5.2 The  HIE system shall be able to detect security-relevant events that it mediates and generate audit records for them. At a minimum the events shall include: start/stop, user login/logout, session timeout, account lockout, patient record created/viewed/updated/deleted, scheduling, query, order, node-authentication failure, signature created/validated, PHI export (e.g. print), PHI import, and security administration events.? Note: The system is only responsible for auditing security events that it mediates. A mediated event is an event that the system has some active role in allowing or causing to happen or has opportunity to detect. The system is not expected to create audit logs entries for security events that it does not mediate. This criteria is intended to apply to system administrative functions performed by the HIE."

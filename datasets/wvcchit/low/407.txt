"The system must be able to associate permissions with a user using one or more of the following access controls: 1) user-based (access rights assigned to each user) 2) role-based (users are grouped and access rights assigned to these groups) or 3) context-based (role-based with additional access rights assigned or restricted based on the context of the transaction such as time-of-day, workstation-location, emergency-mode, etc.)"

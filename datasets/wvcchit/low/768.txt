"The system shall limit an EHR-S user?s ability to deny (repudiate) the origination, receipt, or authorization of a data exchange by that user so  that the source of the data record can not later deny that it is the source that the sender or receiver of a message cannot later deny having sent or received the message. Non-repudiation may be achieved through the use of technical methods."
